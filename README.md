# license_plate_finder
This project alllows searching a specified directory for a license plate of interest extracted from a MySQL database.  The OCR software used is PyTesseract.
OpenCV is used to find license plates in images.  There is a test set of images, however, the database is hosted on my computer, so that is likely not accessible.
The next version will likely include a sqllite database to enable a demonstration.  This was done for my Capstone project at Regis University.
